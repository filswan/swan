# When running aria2 on FreeBSD with ZFS, disable disk-cache due to ZFS using
# Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC). ZFS can also take advantage of the "sparse
# files" format which is significantly faster then pre allocation of file
# space. For other file systems like EXT4 and XFS you can test with "prealloc"
# and "falloc" to see which file-allocation allows arai2 to start quicker and
# use less disk I/O.

# Concurrent downloads: Set the number of different servers to download from
# concurrently; i.e. in parallel. If we are downloading a single file then
# split that file into the same amount of streams. Make sure to keep in mind
# that if the amount of parallel downloads times the lowest-speed-limit is
# greater then your total download bandwidth then you will drop servers
# incorrectly. For example, we have ten(10) connections at a minimum of
# 50KiB/sec which equals 500KiB/sec. If our total download bandwidth is not at
# least 500KiB/sec then arai2 will think the mirrors are too slow and drop
# connection slowing down the whole download. Do not set the
# max-connection-per-server greater then one(1) as to avoid abusing a single
# server.
